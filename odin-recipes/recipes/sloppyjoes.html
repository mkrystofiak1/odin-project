        <li>15 oz can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 lb lean ground beef, 85%-90% lean</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper, or to taste</li>

        <li>1/4 cup water, optional, or added to desired consistency</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns, toasted if desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Finely chop the onion. Seed and finely dice the green pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a bowl, combine the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, brown sugar, and tomato sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a large skillet or dutch oven over medium/high heat. Add olive oil and ground beef. 
            Saute the beef for about 5 minutes until cooked through and no longer pink, breaking it up with a spatula. 
            Season with salt and pepper and add in the diced peppers and onion. Cook another 5 minutes until the veggies 
            are tender and beef is browned.</li>
        <li>
            Add the minced garlic and saute 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly. Add in the sauce and bring to 
            a light boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 10-15 minutes or until thickened to your liking. 
            Season to taste with salt and pepper and add water if you prefer a looser consistency. Serve on toasted buns for 
            Sloppy Joe Sandwiches.
