First Update:

This is the first html project of the Odin-Project, a basic recipe website that consists
of a main index page with links to a few recipes. No CSS yet.

Second Update:

Implementing basic CSS principles to style the recipe pages. Not trying to make the website
look professional or "good", but to clean it up a little bit.
